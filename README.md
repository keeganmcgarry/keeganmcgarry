## Welcome to My Portfolio

I am a research engineer with 3+ years of industry experience in software test and evaluation and systems engineering. I recently completed a masterâ€™s degree in computer science from Georgia Tech, and Iâ€™m now seeking data-focused roles to leverage my technical expertise and passion for taking a data-driven and human-centered approach to solving complex and intersectional problems. My goal is to apply my skills and experience in data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development to drive innovative solutions.
