## Welcome to My Portfolio

Hi, I'm Keegan, a Data Scientist with a background in Systems Engineering and Software Testing and a passion for taking a data-driven and human-centered approach to solving complex and intersectional problems across a multitude of domains. You'll find a collection of projects here that showcase my skills in data science, machine learning, and UX/UI design applied to gaining insights into topics from digital humanities and psychological research to music and travel.
